I'm a Research Scientist at [Codec Avatars Lab, Meta](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/codecavatars/). I received Ph.D. degree in [Australian National University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_University), supervised by [Hongdong Li](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hongdong/) and [Yasuyuki Matsushita](http://www-infobiz.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/member/matsushita/). I received B. Eng degree in [Shanghai Jiaotong University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Jiao_Tong_University).

My research is focused on reconstructing photorealistic humans in 3D, creating next generation digital avatars.

If you are interested in interning at Meta with me, please send an email with your resume and research interests.
